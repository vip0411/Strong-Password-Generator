# Strong-Password-Generator

This Python script provides a user-friendly GUI application to generate secure, random passwords. It combines the functionality of the original code with a Tkinter-based GUI for a more interactive experience.

## Features

Generates strong passwords with lowercase, uppercase, digits, and symbols.
User can specify the desired password length.
Generated password is displayed in a text box for easy viewing and copying.
Clear and concise interface for ease of use.
Optional: Customize window size and appearance (refer to code comments for details).
## Installation

Prerequisites: Ensure you have Python 3.x and tkinter installed. If not, install them using pip install python3 tkinter.

Clone or Download: Clone the repository or download the Python file.

## Usage

Run the Script: Execute the Python script using your preferred method (e.g., python password_generator_gui.py).

Input Password Length: Enter your desired password length in the designated entry field.

Generate Password: Click the "Generate Password" button.

View Generated Password: The generated password will be displayed in the text box below.

## Customization (Optional)

The code includes comments on how to customize the GUI's appearance:

Window Size: Modify the window.geometry() line in the code to adjust the window size (width x height).
## Security Considerations

Generated passwords should be kept confidential. Avoid displaying or storing them in plain text.
Consider using a dedicated password manager for enhanced security measures.
